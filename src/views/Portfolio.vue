    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2">Canton of Aargau</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">I'm going to complete my apprenticeship at the canton of Aargau in July 2020. During my
      apprenticeship I was able to work with a broad tech stack ranging from the backend to the frontend.</p>
    <p>I also lead a project to merge various solutions for recurring filesystem operations into a single centralized
      service, saving time and reducing complexity of the internal infrastructure.</p>
